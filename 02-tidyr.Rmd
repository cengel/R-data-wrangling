`dplyr` pairs well with **`tidyr`** which enables you to flexibly convert between different tabular formats for plotting and analysis.

The package **`tidyr`** addresses a very common problem of needing to reshape your data for plotting, for statistical summaries, or for use by different R functions. 


## About long and wide table format

The **"long" format** is where:

1. each column is a variable
2. each row is an observation
3. each value must have its own cell

In a **"wide" format** we see modifications to rule 1, where each column no longer represents a single variable. Instead, columns can represent different levels or values of the same variable. Each observation type has its own column, like surveys, where each row could be an interview respondent and each column represents one possible answer to the same question. Another example are repeated observations over time, where each column represents, for example, a year. 

```{r wide-vs-long, echo=FALSE, results='asis', out.width='30%', fig.cap='Wide (left) vs. Long (right) Table Format', eval=TRUE}
knitr::include_graphics('img/wide-vs-long.png')
```

Long and wide data frame layouts affect readability. You may find that visually you may prefer the "wide" format, since you can see more of the data on the screen. However, all of the R functions we have used thus far expect for your data to be in a "long" data format. It simplifies the use of the functions and makes your code clearer and more efficient. The long format is more machine readable and is closer to the formatting of databases.

Moving back and forth between these formats can be cumbersome, and **`tidyr`** provides the tools for this to make it easier.

To learn more about **`tidyr`** after the workshop, you may want to check out this [cheatsheet about **`tidyr`**](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/main/tidyr.pdf).

## Long to Wide with `pivot_wider`

Now let's see this in action. First, using **`dplyr`**, let's create a data frame with the counts of different violations for each county:

```{r, purl=FALSE}
violations <- stops %>%
  count(county_name, violation, name = "n_violations")

violations
```

```{r, results='show', echo = FALSE, purl=FALSE}
head(violations)
```

Now, to make this long data wide, we use `pivot_wider` from `tidyr` to turn the different violation types into columns, where each possible value of the violation variable receives its own column.

`pivot_wider()` takes three principal arguments:

1. the data
2. the `names_from` column variable whose values will become new column names.
3. the `values_from` column variable whose values will fill the new column cells.
 
We'll use a pipe into `pivot_wider` so we can leave out the data argument.

```{r, results='show', purl=FALSE}
violations_wide <- violations %>%
  pivot_wider(names_from = violation, 
              values_from = n_violations) 

violations_wide
```

It is worth taking a look at `?pivot_wider`. The function takes many more arguments which can help in reshaping, renaming the new columns, and instructions for how to treat the values or how to fill missing values.


## Wide to long with `pivot_longer`

What if we had the opposite problem, and wanted to go from a wide to long
format? For that, we use `pivot_longer`, which will increase the number of rows and decrease the number of columns. 

We are gathering the multiple violation columns and turn them into a pair of new variables. One variable includes the column names as values, and the other variable contains the values in each cell previously associated with the column names. 

`pivot_longer()` takes four principal arguments:

1. the data
2. `cols` are the names of the columns we use to fill the a new values variable (or to drop).
3. the `names_to` a string specifying the name of the column to create from the data stored in the column names (`cols`)
4. the `values_to` which is also a string, specifying the name of the column to create from the data stored in cell values.

So, to go backwards from `violations_wide`, and exclude `county_name` from the long format, we would do the following:

```{r, results='show', purl=FALSE}
violations_long <- violations_wide %>%
  pivot_longer(cols = -county_name,        # exclude column with county name
               names_to = "violation",     # name is a string!
               values_to = "n_violations")            # also a string

violations_long
```

We could also have used a specification for what columns to include. This can be
useful if you have a large number of identifying columns, and it's easier to
specify what to gather than what to leave alone. And if the columns are adjacent to each other, we don't even need to list them all out -- we can use the `:` operator!

```{r, results='show', purl=FALSE}
violations_wide %>%
  pivot_longer(cols = `Breaks-Lights-etc`:Speeding,      # this also works
               names_to = "violation", 
               values_to = "n")
```

There are many powerful operations you can do with the `pivot_*` functions. To learn more review the vignette:

```{r, results='show', eval=FALSE}
vignette("pivot")
```

## Reshaping challenges

## From the stops dataframe create a wide data frame `tr_wide` 
## with "year" as columns, with "violation" as rows, 
## and the values are the number of traffic stops per each violation,
## roughly like this:

## violation      | 2013 | 2014 | 2015 ...
## Break-Lights   |   65 |    54|   67 ...
## Speeding       |  713 |   948|  978 ...
## ...

## Use year() from the lubridate package. Hint: You will need to summarize 
## and count the traffic stops before reshaping the table.

## Now take the data frame, and make it long again, so each row is a 
## unique violation - year combination, like this:

## violation  | year | n of stops
## Speeding   | 2013 | 65
## Speeding   | 2014 | 54
## ... etc

```

<!---
  ```{r, echo=FALSE, purl=FALSE}
## Answer 1
library(lubridate)
tr_wide <- stops %>%
  mutate(year = year(stop_date)) %>% 
  count(violation, year) %>%
  pivot_wider(names_from = year, values_from = n)

tr_wide

## Answer 2
tr_wide %>%
  pivot_longer(cols = -violation, names_to = "year", values_to = "n_stops")

```

## Exporting data 

Similar to the `read_csv()` function used for reading CSV files into R, there is a `write_csv()` function that generates CSV files from data frames.

Before using `write_csv()`, we are going to create a new folder, `data_output`,
in our working directory that will store this generated dataset. We don't want
to write generated datasets in the same directory as our raw data. It's good
practice to keep them separate. The `data` folder should only contain the raw,
unaltered data, and should be left alone to make sure we don't delete or modify
it. In contrast, our script will generate the contents of the `data_output`
directory, so even if the files it contains are deleted, we can always
re-generate them.

We can now save the table generated above  in our `data_output`
folder:

```{r, purl=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
write_csv(violation_wide, "data_output/county_violations.csv")
```

```{r, purl=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
if (!file.exists("data_output")) dir.create("data_output")

write_csv(violations_wide, "data_output/county_violations.csv")
```
