# Prerequisites and Preparations {-}

- You should have some **basic knowledge** of R, and be familiar with the topics covered in the [Introduction to R](https://cengel.github.io/R-intro/).
- Have a recent version of [R](https://cran.r-project.org/) and [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/) installed. 
- Install and load the `tidyverse` package.
- Download `MS_trafficstops_bw.csv` from here: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cengel/R-data-wrangling/master/data/MS_trafficstops_bw_age.csv
- Download `MS_acs2015_bw.csv` from here: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cengel/R-data-wrangling/master/data/MS_acs2015_bw.csv
- Recommended: Create a new RStudio project `R-data-ws` in a new folder `R-data-ws` and download both CSV files into a subdirectory called `data`.
